`core-header-panel` contains a header section and a content panel section. Special
support is provided for scrolling modes when one uses a core-toolbar or equivalent
for the header section.

Example:

    <core-header-panel>
      <core-toolbar>Header</core-toolbar>
      <div>Content goes here...</div>
    </core-header-panel>

If you want to use other than `core-toolbar` for the header, add 
`core-header` class to that element.

Example:

    <core-header-panel>
      <div class="core-header">Header</div>
      <div>Content goes here...</div>
    </core-header-panel>

There are six different modes of header and scrolling behaviors.

`standard`: The header is a step above the panel. The header will consume the 
panel at the point of entry, preventing it from passing through to the 
opposite side.

`seamed`: The header is presented as seamed with the panel.

`waterfall`: Similar to standard mode, but header is initially presented as 
seamed with panel, but then separates to form the step.

`waterfall-tall`: The header is initially taller (`tall` class is added to 
the header).  As the user scrolls, the header separates (forming an edge)
while condensing (`tall` class is removed from the header).

`scroll`: The header keeps its seam with the panel, and is pushed off screen.

`cover`: The panel covers the whole `core-header-panel` including the
header. This allows user to style the panel in such a way that the panel is
partially covering the header.
 
    <core-header-panel mode="cover">
      <core-appbar class="tall">
        <core-icon-button icon="menu"></core-icon-button>
      </core-appbar>
      <div class="content" style="margin: 60px"></div>
    </core-header-panel>
